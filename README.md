## 🎯 About VisJudgeBench

VisJudgeBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLM visualization aesthetics and quality. It contains **3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios**, covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across **32 chart types**. Each sample includes visualization images, six-dimensional quality scores based on the **Fidelity-Expressiveness-Aesthetics** evaluation framework, and evaluation prompts.

  <p><em>Why we need specialized visualization assessment: MLLMs excel at general aesthetics but struggle with visualization-specific evaluation</em></p>
</div>

## 🔍 Evaluation Framework

Our benchmark evaluates visualizations across three fundamental dimensions, operationalized into six measurable metrics:

  <p><em>The Fidelity-Expressiveness-Aesthetics evaluation framework with positive and negative examples</em></p>
</div>

**1. Fidelity - Data Accuracy and Truthfulness**

- `data_fidelity`: Evaluates whether visual encodings accurately reflect the original data, avoiding misleading interpretations caused by improper axis settings, scale distortions, or other design flaws.

**2. Expressiveness - Information Clarity and Understandability**

- `semantic_readability`: Assesses the clarity of basic information encoding and whether users can unambiguously decode visual elements.
- `insight_discovery`: Evaluates the effectiveness in revealing deep data patterns, trends, or outliers, helping users transition from "reading information" to "gaining insights".

**3. Aesthetics - Visual Aesthetics and Refinement**

- `design_style`: Measures the innovation and uniqueness of design, including novel visual elements and distinctive style.
- `visual_composition`: Focuses on the rationality of spatial layout, evaluating the balance and order of element positioning, size proportions, and spacing arrangements.
- `color_harmony`: Assesses the coordination and functionality of color combinations, ensuring color palette choices balance aesthetics with effective information communication.

## 🏗️ Benchmark Construction

Our benchmark follows a rigorous three-stage construction pipeline to ensure high-quality annotations:

**Key Observations:**

- All models struggle most with **Aesthetics dimensions** (Design Style, Visual Composition, Color Harmony)
- **Data Fidelity** is relatively easier but still challenging for most models
- **VisJudge consistently outperforms** baseline models across all six dimensions

### 📊 Do MLLMs Exhibit Human-like Scoring Behaviors?

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/score_distribution_density_for_paper.jpg" alt="Score Distribution" width="90%">
  <p><em>Rating patterns of different models compared to human experts (μ<sub>human</sub>=3.13)</em></p>
</div>

**Systematic Biases Revealed:**

- **Score Inflation**: Most models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B μ=3.89, Claude-3.5-Sonnet μ=3.87) tend to over-rate visualizations
- **Overly Conservative**: Gemini-2.5-Pro (μ=3.02) tends to under-rate visualizations
- **Perfect Alignment**: VisJudge (μ=3.11) achieves near-perfect alignment with human rating distribution (μ=3.13)

### 📈 How Does Visualization Complexity Affect Model Performance?

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/model_performance_comparison_radar.jpg" alt="Model Performance Radar Chart" width="90%">
  <p><em>Model-human rating correlation across different visualization types and evaluation dimensions</em></p>
</div>

**Key Insights:**

- All models show **performance degradation** as complexity increases: Single Vis > Multi Vis > Dashboard
- VisJudge maintains the **best performance** across all types: 0.577 (Single), 0.565 (Multi), 0.375 (Dashboard)
- **Aesthetic dimensions** (especially Visual Composition) are most challenging in complex dashboards

### 🔍 How Do Model Evaluation Behaviors Differ in Practice?

Our case studies reveal two common biases in model evaluation behaviors: **score inflation** and **overly conservative** assessments.

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/casestudy_new.jpg" alt="Score Inflation Examples" width="100%">
  <p><em>Model evaluation examples on low-quality visualizations showing score inflation bias</em></p>
</div>

**Score Inflation:** For a chaotic treemap (human rating: 1.67), baseline models give inflated scores. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL-7B (3.67) praises its "clear legend" while ignoring the confusing layout, and Claude-4-Sonnet (3.08) incorrectly highlights "excellent spatial organization". In contrast, VisJudge's score of 2.00 aligns with human judgment, correctly identifying the "chaotic layout" that impairs interpretation.

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/case3.jpg" alt="Conservative Bias Examples" width="100%">
  <p><em>Case study highlighting the conservative bias of Gemini-2.5-Pro</em></p>
</div>

**Overly Conservative:** Conversely, Gemini-2.5-Pro exhibits overly conservative bias. For a high-quality dashboard rated 4.17 by humans, Gemini-2.5-Pro gives a disproportionately low score of 2.94, focusing on a single data inconsistency while overlooking the chart's overall effectiveness. Similarly, for another chart (human rating: 3.56), it scores only 2.33 due to the use of dual Y-axes. VisJudge demonstrates more balanced evaluations (3.83 and 3.00, respectively).

## 📋 Data Format

The dataset is stored in JSON format (`VisJudgeBench.json`), where each entry contains the following fields:

- **`_id`**: Unique identifier for each sample
- **`type`**: Visualization category (`single_vis`, `multi_vis`, or `dashboard`)
- **`subtype`**: Specific subcategory within the main type
- **`image_path`**: Path to the corresponding visualization image
- **`overall_score`**: Overall quality score (average of six dimension scores, ranging from 1.0 to 5.0)
- **`dimension_scores`**: Six-dimensional quality assessment scores (see Evaluation Framework above for detailed descriptions of each dimension)
- **`prompt`**: Complete evaluation prompt with detailed scoring criteria for each dimension

### 💡 Example Entry

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "type": "dashboard",
  "subtype": "analytical_dashboard",
  "image_path": "images/dashboard/example.png",

## 🤖 VisJudge Model

To address the significant gaps between general MLLMs and human expert judgment in visualization quality assessment, we developed **VisJudge** — a specialized model fine-tuned on our benchmark data using the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method. VisJudge is based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and trained specifically for visualization quality assessment across the **Fidelity-Expressiveness-Aesthetics** dimensions.

### Performance Highlights

- 🎯 **19.8% MAE improvement** over GPT-5 (0.442 vs 0.551)
- 📈 **58.7% higher correlation** with human experts compared to GPT-5 (0.681 vs 0.429)
- 🏅 **Outperforms all commercial MLLMs** across all metrics on visualization assessment tasks

### Quick Start

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration
from peft import PeftModel
import torch

# Load base model and LoRA weights
base_model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto"
)

model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "xypkent/visjudge-7b")
